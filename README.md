# 15-Puzzle
 
I made this project when I learned about sprites and I really wanted to apply them somewhere and also the game should be easy to make as it was my first project using sprites.  So, I chose this and it was very easy to implement the logic and get the game working but the main problem I faced was with the moving animations.  

I had a hard time figuring out the problems. But ultimately I succeeded in that.  

The code is not very nicely written. Feel free to share your suggestions. ;)
